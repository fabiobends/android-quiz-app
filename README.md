# Quiz App

Third project coded on "Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass"

I learned how to:

- create more screens (activities)
- use `Intent` to navigate between activities and also pass data through
- create custom XMLs (drawable) and using them as assets
- import local images to use on the app
- create a model of a data (data class)
- create reusable constants (object)
- use `tools:` property on XMLs to draw UI and see expected result (seen on "Layout Mode" only)
- edit `AndroidManifest.xml` to set global behaviors on the app, for instance: remove title bar and set app to portrait orientation only
